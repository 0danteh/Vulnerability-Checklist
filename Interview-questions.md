**1. What is Cyber Security?**

* Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks or unauthorized access. It involves implementing measures and technologies to safeguard digital information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

**2. What is Penetration Testing?**

* Penetration testing is a process used to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, web and mobile application. Penetration testers use a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to assess the impact of the vulnerabilities.

**3. What is Vulnerability Assessment?**

* Vulnerability assessment involves using automated tools to systematically scan and identify potential security vulnerabilities within a system, network, or application. These tools generate reports that categorize and rank vulnerabilities based on their severity.

**4. What is CIA?**

**The CIA triad is a foundational security model used to set up security policies and systems. The core principles of the model are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.**

**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.

**Integrity** means that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable.

**Availability** means that the data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. 

**Authentication** The process of verifying who someone is

**Authorization** The concept of granting access to specific resources in a system

**Vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

**Risk** is Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

**Threat** is Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**5. What Is the OSI Model?**

**The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.**

1. Physical Layer - This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches.
  
2. Data Link Layer - The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network.
  
3. Network Layer - data transfer between two different networks.
 
4. Transport Layer - Ensures reliable end-to-end communication, flow control, and error recovery between devices.
  
5. Session Layer - This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices.

6. Presentation Layer - The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.

7. Application Layer - This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user.

**6. What is Firewall?**

* A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls helps to protect systems and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and potential security threats.

**7. what is the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption?**

**There are two main types of encryption:**

* Symmetric encryption is the use of a single secret key to exchange information. Because it uses one key for encryption and decryption, the sender and receiver must know the secret key to lock or unlock the cipher.

* Asymmetric encryption is the use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data. It uses two separate keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the private key decrypts it. The private key is only given to users with authorized access.

**8. Steps involved in a typical penetration testing process**

* Reconnaissance - The tester gathers as much more information about the target.

* Scanning - Involves using various tools to identify live hosts, open ports, and services on the target network. Vulnerability scanning helps to detect potential weaknesses and misconfigurations in the target environment.
        
* Vulnerability Assessment - The tester uses all the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
        
* Exploitation - The penetration tester attempts to access the target system and exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
        
* Reporting - The tester prepares a report documenting the penetration tester's findings.

**9. What is OWASP?**

**OWASP stands for the Open Web Application Security Project. It is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the software security.**

1. Broken Access Control
2. cryptographic failure
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfigurations
6. Vulnerable & Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

**1. What is Broken Access Control?**

* Broken Access Control is a type of application security vulnerability that enables users to access data and functionalities that they should not have access to. In most cases of Broken Access Control attacks, a malicious user takes advantage of weak or non-implementation of access control in the target application.

2. What is cryptographic failure?
