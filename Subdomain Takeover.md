# What is Subdomain Takeover?

Subdomain takeover is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can take control of a subdomain that is pointing to an external service that is no longer in use or misconfigured. This can lead to phishing, malware distribution, defacement, or other malicious activities.

# Step 1: Subdomain Enumeration

The first step in a subdomain takeover is to identify potential targets. This is typically done through subdomain enumeration. Subdomains are essentially separate parts of a larger domain that can be used to direct traffic to specific servers or applications. By identifying subdomains that are no longer in use, an attacker can potentially take control of them and use them to host their own malicious content.

**There are several tools that can be used for subdomain enumeration, including:**

1. Subfinder
2. Assetfinder
3. Subdomainizer
4. Sublist3r
5. Findomain

# Step 2: Identifying Live Subdomains

Once potential targets have been identified through subdomain enumeration, the next step is to determine which of those subdomains are actually live and accessible. This is important because attempting to take over a subdomain that is not live will not be effective.

**To use HTTPX and HTTPROBE, simply run the following command:**

1. cat domains.txt | httprobe (Find Live Subdomains)
2. cat domains.txt | httprobe â€” prefer-https (https result)
3. cat livesub.txt | httpx
4. httpx -l livesub.txt -sc -mc 200


# Step 3: Checking for Subdomain Takeover Vulnerabilities

* Once potential targets have been identified and live subdomains have been identified, the next step is to determine if any of the live subdomains are vulnerable to takeover. One way to do this is by using Nuclei takeover templates.

* Nuclei is an open-source project that provides a framework for fast and customisable vulnerability scanning. It includes a variety of templates for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, including takeover templates that can be used to identify subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.

**To use Nuclei, simply run the following command:**

* nuclei -l livesub.txt -t /home/kali/Downloads/detect-all-takeovers.yaml

# Stpe 4: How to check Subdomain Takeover Vulnerability for single or multiple Targets?

Subzy is a Subdomain Takeover Tool and can be used to identify the domain or domains vulnerable to subdomain takeover vulnerability.

**Installation**

1. git clone https://github.com/PentestPad/subzy.git
2. cd subzy
3. go build -o subzy main.go
4. ./subzy run --target example.com (Single Domain)
5. ./subzy run --targets list.txt (List of Domain)
