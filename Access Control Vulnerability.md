# What is access control?
Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. In the context of web applications, **access control is dependent on authentication and session management:**

1. **Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are.
2. **Session management** identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
3. **Access control** determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

# What is Privilege escalation:
Accessing those resources for which user do not have authorization by escalating the privilege comes under Privilege escalation.

There are multiple ways to achieve this such as by modifying user, directly accessing URL. Ultimate goal of attacker is to access sensitive data, API tokens, bypassing user controls or performing any malicious actions. It has two types:

**1. Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** If user accesses the resource of the another user who have same level access rights then its known as the horizontal privilege escalation.
**As User ‘A’ can take privilege of User ‘B’.**

**2. Vertical privilege escalation:** If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. For example, if a non-administrative user can gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation. 
**As “normal user” can take privilege of “admin”.**

# What is Insecure direct object references (IDOR)?

Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.
