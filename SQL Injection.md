What is SQL Injection (SQLi) Vulnerability?

* A security weakness in web applications that interact with databases using SQL (Structured Query Language). Malicious actors (attackers) can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code into user input fields, altering the intended SQL queries.

**This allows attackers to potentially:**
        
1. Steal sensitive data (usernames, passwords, personal information)
2. Modify or delete data (change website content, corrupt databases)
3. Gain unauthorized access to the database or even the underlying server

**Type of SQL Injection**

* In Band
* Out of Band
* Blind SQLI

**SQLI Exploitation Technique**

* Error Based Exploitation
* Union Based Exploitation
* Boolean Based Exploitation
* Time-Based Delay Exploitation
* Out of Band Exploitation

**Try to Identify- where the application interact with DB**

* Authentication Page
* Search Fields
* Post Fields
* Get Fields
* HTTP Header
* Cookie

**Basic SQL Functions**

1. SELECT - read data from the database based on search criteria
2. INSERT - insert new data into the database
3. UPDATE - update existing data based on given criteria
4. DELETE - delete existing data based on given criteria
5. Order By - used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order
6. Limit By -	the statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables

**How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities**

* You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:

1. The single quote character ' or a semicolon ; and \ backslash look for errors or other anomalies.
2. Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.


**1. Retrieving hidden data**

* SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data Modify the parameter valuse, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--

**2. SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass**

**Subverting application logic**

**Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'**

**If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.**

**In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''**

**This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user**
