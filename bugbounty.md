# Common Mistakes Made by Bug Bounty Hunters as a beginner

1. Not thoroughly understanding the scope of the program 

Before diving into testing, it’s essential to carefully review the bug bounty program’s scope and guidelines. This includes understanding the in-scope targets, the types of vulnerabilities that are eligible for rewards, and the reporting process. Failing to grasp the scope can lead to wasting time on out-of-scope targets or submitting invalid reports. 

2. Jumping for exploitation without understanding the application

Many of us while hunting, run for exploitation without proper recon. Also understanding the functionality of the system and its features will be always an advantage on catching deep scope bugs.

3. Not properly testing for all types of vulnerabilities

Bug hunting is not just about finding one type of vulnerability. It is essential to test for all types of vulnerabilities, including web, mobile, and network vulnerabilities, to increase your chances of success. To avoid this mistake, make sure to familiarize yourself with different types of vulnerabilities and use the appropriate tools and techniques to test for them.

4. Not learning from mistakes

Learning from mistakes is crucial to improving bug hunting skills. It helps the hunter avoid making the same mistakes in the future and improves the chances of success. To avoid this mistake, make sure to reflect on your mistakes and learn from them.

5. Changing my target consistently, and not being patient.
